# cuneiformatic
Turns a unicode text into a Babylonian cuneiform number using Python and Latex. 

These pieces of code were made for the artwork 'Spijkerkunde' (English: 'Cuneiformatic') for the BANG! festival in Leuven during 2021. 

It allows to turn unicode text inside the peano.txt file into Latex-commands. These commands can later be added to a Latex file as is demonstrated in cuneiform.tex. 

disclaimer: this code is as-is but should be a start for anyone trying to display weird symbols in latex or translate them into codes of arbitrary base.
